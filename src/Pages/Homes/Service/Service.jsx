        The Samsung Care Network has enough locations across the country that 75% of Americans have access to one of the participating locations. At those locations, most repairs are made within two hours with a prior appointment at 3pm or before and for Galaxy S21 Models and Up.

        <p className="text-sm my-4 text-justify">
        Both in-warranty and out-of-warranty service-from replacing a cracked screen to repairing a faulty charging port-are included, and all requires are handled by certified technicians using genuine Samsung parts.
